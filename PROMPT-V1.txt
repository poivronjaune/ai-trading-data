Pretty good, I had an idea for a python app. I want you to help me write a PRD.
The app is a simple package called gitdata. It is a play of words on github price data :).
Here some elements to consider:
-DOwnload mixed up price data from a public github repo.
-The repo may contain many files, we can assume they are all CSV files that containOHLCV price data with a datetime index and a ticker symbol.
-The app must offer a simple console interface to select a github uer and repo name
-Once we activate the download, it will download all files, ideally one by one and create a new csv file for each ticker.
-The save process must check that there are noe datetime repetitions, if the row being treated is a duplicate ignore it and skip to the next row

So build a PRD document that I will use to generate an app with.
